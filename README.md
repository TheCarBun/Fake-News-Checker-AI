# [AI Fact Checker](https://isitfakenews.streamlit.app/)

[AI Fact Checker](https://isitfakenews.streamlit.app/) is a simple web application that allows users to verify facts and claims using an AI-powered backend. The app is built with Streamlit for the user interface and leverages a Langflow API endpoint for fact-checking responses.

## Features

- **User-friendly UI:** Enter any query or claim in a text box.
- **AI-powered fact checking:** Queries are sent to a Langflow-powered API for analysis.
- **Instant results:** Get clear, concise fact-checking output in seconds.

## How It Works

1. The user enters a query or statement to be fact-checked.
2. Upon clicking the "Fact Check" button, the app sends the input to a Langflow API endpoint.
3. The API processes the input and returns a fact-checked response.
4. The result is displayed in the Streamlit app.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- [Streamlit](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started/installation)
